# Dimensional Data Mart Model

A dimensional data model for sales data mart where the fact grain is the sale ticket. Each time the POS produces a purchase ticket, a fact measurement is captured. So, the grain is defined as the sale's ticket generated by the POS.

Some of the business questions were:

- Which payment credit card was the most used per state?
- How much was last yearâ€™s Wisconsin sales?
- Is there a correlation between the number of cashier at each department store with the day, month or season of the year?
- Total taxes paid to the local government per month
